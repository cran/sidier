\usage{
rule(summary=NULL,rule=NULL,stat.intra="max",
stat.inter="min",pch.intra=16, pch.inter=16,
pch.out=21,col.intra="gray",col.inter="black",

}
\arguments{
  \item{summary}{
a list produced by \code{\link{barcode.summary}}. From this list, the maximum intraspecific and the minimu interspecific distances per species are represented. To use any other intra- and interspecific distance, use the "inter" and "intra" options.
}
 \item{rule}{
a numeric. Only species showing interspecific distances higher than 'rule' times the intraspecific distances will be considered for threshold estimation.
}
 \item{stat.intra}{a string, the inter-specific statistic used to estimate the quotient interspecific/intraspecific. Accepted values are "max", "min", "median", and "mean"
}
 \item{stat.inter}{a string, the inter-specific statistic used to estimate the quotient interspecific/intraspecific. Accepted values are "max", "min", "median", and "mean".
}
\item{pch.intra}{Either an integer or single character defining the symbol to be used for intraspecific distances. Only species showing a ratio interspecific/intraspecific higher than the value defined by 'rule' are affected by 'pch.intra'.
}
\item{pch.inter}{Either an integer or single character defining the symbol to be used for interspecific distances Only species showing a ratio interspecific/intraspecific higher than the value defined by 'rule' are affected by 'pch.inter'.
}
\item{pch.out}{Either an integer or single character defining the symbol to be used for species showing a ratio interspecific/intraspecific lower than the value defined by 'rule'.
}
\item{col.intra}{Either an integer or string defining the colour for intraspecific distances showing a ratio interspecific/intraspecific higher than the value defined by 'rule'.
}
\item{col.inter}{Either an integer or string defining the colour for interspecific distances showing a ratio interspecific/intraspecific higher than the value defined by 'rule'.
}
\item{col.out}{Either an integer or string defining the colour forspecies showing a ratio interspecific/intraspecific lower than the value defined by 'rule'.
}
\item{label}{a string to set node labels on those species showing a ratio interspecific/intraspecific higher than the value defined ("rule"), on species showing a ratio interspecific/intraspecific higher than the value defined ("norule"), on all species ("all"). Any other value will produce no lable 
}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\item{Intraspecific}{a matrix containing information about the intraspecific distances.
}
\item{Interspecific}{a matrix containing information about the interspecific distances.
}
In both cases, the information provided is the minimum, maximum, median, mean, first and third quartile values.
