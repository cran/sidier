\title{Modified Complex Indel Coding as distance matrix
}
\description{This function computes an indel distance matrix following the rationale of the Modified Complex Indel Coding (Muller, 2006) to estimate transition matrices. 
}
\usage{
MCIC(inputFile = NA, align = NA, saveFile = TRUE, outname =
paste(inputFile, "IndelDistanceMatrixMullerMod.txt"), silent = FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{inputFile}{the name of the fasta file to be analysed. Alternatively you can provide the name of a "DNAbin" class alignment stored in memory using the "align" option.
}
  \item{align}{the name of the alignment to be analysed. See "read.dna" in ape  package for details about reading alignments. Alternatively you can provide the name of the file containing the alignment in fasta format using the "inputFile" option.
}
  \item{saveFile}{a logical; if TRUE (default), function output is saved as a text file.
}
  \item{outname}{if "saveFile" is set to TRUE (default), contains the name of the output file.
}
  \item{silent}{a logical; if FALSE (default), it prints the number of unique
sequences found and the name of the output file.
}
}
\value{A matrix containing the genetic distances estimated as indels pairwise differences.
}
\details{
It is recommended to estimate this distance matrix using only the unique sequences in the
alignment. Repeated sequences increase computation time but do not provide additional 
information (because they produce duplicated rows and columns in the final distance matrix).
