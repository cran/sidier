\title{Get modules and network given a threshold
}
\description{Gets details on modules and connections in the network connecting nodes showing distances equal or lower than the defined threshold value.
}
\usage{
single.network.module(dis,threshold=NA,refer2max=TRUE,out="module",
save.file=FALSE,modFileName="Modules_summary.txt")}

\arguments{
  \item{dis}{the distance matrix to be represented}
  \item{threshold}{a numeric between 0 and 1, is the value of the maximum distance to be considered as a link. This value is referred to the maximum distance in the input matrix (e.g., a value of 0.32 will represent a link between nodes showing distances equal or lower than 32\% of the maximum distance found in the distance matrix).}
 \item{refer2max}{
a logic, "TRUE" to refer the threshold value to the maximum distance in the input matrix (e.g., a value of 0.32 will represent a link between nodes showing distances equal or lower than 32\% of the maximum distance found in the distance matrix). "FALSE" to refer the threshold to a specific value (e.g., a value of 0.32 will represent a link between nodes showing distances equal or lower than 0.32, regardless the maximum distance found in the distance matrix).
}
 \item{out}{a string, the type of output, "module" to get a matrix with two columns giving each sequence name and the module it belongs to, and "network" to get a square matrix representing connection (1) or lack of connection (0) between sequences in the network.}
  \item{save.file}{
a logic, "TRUE" to save the summary of network modules, attributing every individual to a module.
}

 \item{modFileName}{(if modules=TRUE) the name of a generated file containing a summary of module results}
